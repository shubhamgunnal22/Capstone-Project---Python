# Capstone-Project---Python
This project aimed to streamline and analyze data related to employees managing various projects, focusing on their performance, seniority levels, and project outcomes. The process involved cleaning, transforming, and merging multiple datasets to ensure completeness and consistency in the data.

The first step involved handling missing data and enhancing the structure of the employee information by splitting names and improving readability. We then integrated all the dataframes into a single cohesive dataset, allowing for more effective analysis.

Once the data was merged, additional insights were derived by calculating bonuses based on project completion, adjusting employee designations according to project outcomes, and promoting or demoting employees based on certain criteria. We also enhanced the dataset by modifying specific columns, such as appending titles to names and dropping irrelevant columns to maintain clarity.

Further, the analysis involved financial computations, including summarizing the total project cost handled by each employee, and generating filtered views of the data for particular conditions such as location-based queries.

In essence, this project resulted in a clean, enriched, and unified dataset, providing a comprehensive overview of employee performance, project costs, and dynamic changes in designations based on their project success or failure. This final dataset allows for deeper analysis and decision-making regarding employee management and project performance.
